# Lego car controlled with IR
As additional project for the "Reti Logiche" course I have created with Legos a remote controlled car that uses an Arduino Uno on board to control the electronic components, in particular a DC motor, a servomotor and a IR receiver. The remote control is performed using a Wii Nunchuck connected to an Arduino Uno that communicates with the car through an infrared LED. The main feature is that to control the car it can be used ether the joystick or the accelerometers of the Wii Nunchuck. 

The Lego instructions are available [here](./LDD_files/Instructions), while the Lego Digital Designer 3D models can be found [here](./LDD_files/Models). The Arduino software developed is organized in the dedicated folders: [remote](./IRremote), [car](/IRlegocar).

For more details about the system configuration check the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/qfQm9lA7alI).
